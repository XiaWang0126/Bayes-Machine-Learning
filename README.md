# Machine Learning

## Module overview

This module will introduce you with fundamental concepts of machine learning and popular machine learning algorithms and their implementations in R and Python. 

We will learn famous supervised learning and unsupervised learning algorithms and how to use them to solve real-world problems. We aim to understand the intuitions and the physical meanings of the objective functions of the algorithms. We will also know how to use these algorithms in R and Python to complete tasks with real-world datasets.

After this module, you will understand what is machine learning and how to use machine learning methods to solve real-world problems. You will also acquire essential programming skills to apply popular machine learning methods.
