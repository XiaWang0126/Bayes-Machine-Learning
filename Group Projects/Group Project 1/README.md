# Group Project 1 Description

Design your own shiny app that can visualise decision tree and
random forest. The aim of this app is to present to your clients with little knowledge
about machine learning, on how decision tree and random forest work and what are the
conclusions of your analysis of the data. 

Note: 1) You can use any dataset that you like,
but please make sure that the dataset is with less than 500 observations and 50 features
for illustrative purpose. If you find a large dataset that is interesting to analyse, please
down sample the dataset to fit the criterion. 

2) You canâ€™t use R packages that include
shiny apps to visualise decision tree and random forest from other authors.


Please also write a report to show 

1) the task of the dataset, 

2) how you design the app
and how it works and 

3) your analysis of the results obtained from the two classifiers. The
report should be no more than 500 words. You will get a penalty on the report if you
exceed this limit by 10%.
